# shiki-bot
Script for node.js. Thanks to him, you can watch information about the user shiimori.one. (The script works every other time because I did not finish it). Threw out of uselessness (but suddenly useful to someone)
# Warning!

Immediately warn that the bot did not finish (stopped writing because of Krivoy API shikimori). If you use this library, you will need to download several node modules:

1. discord.js
2. superagent

Before starting, be sure to check if the api specified in the library is still valid!
